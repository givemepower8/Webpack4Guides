# Why

webpack provides best practices that ensure the most optimum delivery. Following those practices, web developer are equiped with all kind of tooling support.

For example, a website has different javascript library, assets, css, etc., all the html code are source code, webpack can transpile and package all the files into a dist folder, in which there are maybe just one minified js file and other optimized css and image files.
